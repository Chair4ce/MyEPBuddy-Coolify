-- Fix infinite recursion in workspace collaboration RLS policies
-- The issue was cross-table references in policies causing circular dependency

-- Drop existing problematic policies
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Host can manage their sessions" ON workspace_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Participants can view sessions they joined" ON workspace_sessions;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can view participants in their sessions" ON workspace_session_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can join sessions" ON workspace_session_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Users can leave sessions" ON workspace_session_participants;
DROP POLICY IF EXISTS "Host can remove participants" ON workspace_session_participants;

-- Simplified policies for workspace_sessions
-- Host can do everything with their own sessions
CREATE POLICY "workspace_sessions_host_all"
  ON workspace_sessions
  FOR ALL
  TO authenticated
  USING (host_user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (host_user_id = auth.uid());

-- Anyone authenticated can SELECT active sessions (needed for joining by code)
-- The actual access control is handled at the application level
CREATE POLICY "workspace_sessions_select_active"
  ON workspace_sessions
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (is_active = true);

-- Simplified policies for workspace_session_participants
-- Users can see all participants in any session they're part of
CREATE POLICY "workspace_participants_select"
  ON workspace_session_participants
  FOR SELECT
  TO authenticated
  USING (true); -- Allow reading all participants - session privacy handled by session lookup

-- Users can insert themselves as participants
CREATE POLICY "workspace_participants_insert_self"
  ON workspace_session_participants
  FOR INSERT
  TO authenticated
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can update their own participation (e.g., set left_at)
CREATE POLICY "workspace_participants_update_self"
  ON workspace_session_participants
  FOR UPDATE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid())
  WITH CHECK (user_id = auth.uid());

-- Users can delete their own participation
CREATE POLICY "workspace_participants_delete_self"
  ON workspace_session_participants
  FOR DELETE
  TO authenticated
  USING (user_id = auth.uid());
