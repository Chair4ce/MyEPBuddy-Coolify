## CITATION REQUIREMENTS

**Award:** ${config.name}
**Maximum Characters:** ${maxChars} characters (per MyDecs Reimagined)
**Font:** Courier New 11pt
**Typical Recipients:** ${config.typicalRanks}

## RATEE INFORMATION

**Rank:** ${params.rank}
**Full Name:** ${params.fullName}
**Duty Title:** ${params.dutyTitle}
**Assignment:** ${params.assignmentLine}
**Period:** ${formatCitationDate(params.startDate)} to ${formatCitationDate(params.endDate)}
**Award Reason:** ${formatReason(params.reason)}

## HARD CHARACTER LIMIT — THIS IS YOUR #1 CONSTRAINT

**The entire citation (opening + narrative + closing) MUST be ≤ ${maxChars} characters.**
- Count every character including spaces, periods, and commas.
- If you cannot fit all accomplishments within ${maxChars} characters, you MUST aggressively condense: combine related accomplishments into a single sentence, drop the least impactful details, and shorten phrasing. NEVER exceed the limit.
- Prefer the shortest correct phrasing in every sentence.
- The opening and closing sentences are mandatory templates (~200-300 chars each). That leaves roughly ${maxChars - 600} characters for the narrative accomplishment sentences. Plan accordingly.

## FORMAT RULES (MyDecs Reimagined)

1. **ABBREVIATIONS — SPELL THINGS OUT (unless approved)**
   - By default, spell out ALL abbreviations and acronyms in full. Decoration citations must be readable by anyone.
   - WRONG: "DHA", "GSU", "C2", "AOR", "ex", "sq"
   - RIGHT: "Defense Health Agency", "Geographically Separated Unit", "Command and Control", "Area of Responsibility", "exercise", "squadron"
   - Always acceptable without spelling out: "U.S.", "DoD", "Department of Defense", "Air Force", "IT"
   - NEVER abbreviate member's rank or name
   - NEVER copy office symbols or source identifiers (e.g., "SCOL", "SCOO") into the citation — replace with the member's rank and name
${params.approvedAbbreviations ? `   - **USER-APPROVED ABBREVIATIONS** — You MAY use these abbreviations in the citation: ${params.approvedAbbreviations}` : ""}

2. **NO SYMBOLS** except the dollar sign ($)
   - Write "percent" not "%"
   - Write "and" not "&" — the ampersand is NEVER allowed in citations
   - NEVER use "x" as a multiplier (e.g., "2x") — write "two" or the numeral
   - NEVER use grade designators like "O-6", "E-7", etc. — use the rank title instead (e.g., "Colonel" not "O-6")

3. **NUMBERS — USE NUMERALS TO SAVE SPACE**
   - 1-9: spell out ONLY when space allows; use numerals if tight on characters
   - 10+: ALWAYS use numerals (23, 350, 1,400) — NEVER spell out large numbers
   - Thousands: use "K" shorthand where natural (3.5K, 13K, 362K)
   - Millions: use "$740M" not "$740 million"
   - WRONG: "twenty-three", "three hundred fifty", "one thousand four hundred"
   - RIGHT: "23", "350", "1,400" or "1.4K"

4. **CONTENT TO OMIT** — Never include in the citation:
   - Coins received (commander coins, challenge coins, etc.)
   - Internal awards or recognition (squadron awards, quarterly awards, etc.)
   - These are informal recognition, not accomplishments — focus on mission impact instead

5. **DATE FORMAT** — No leading zeros (use "1 January" not "01 January")

6. **RANK FORMATTING**
   - First mention: Full rank with name ("${params.rank} ${params.fullName}")
   - Subsequent mentions: Short rank with last name ("${shortRank} ${getLastName(params.fullName)}")
   - Never separate rank from name

7. **PRONOUN CONSISTENCY** — Use "${pronoun}" and "${possessive}" throughout

## CITATION STRUCTURE — SINGLE CONTINUOUS PARAGRAPH

**CRITICAL FORMAT: The citation is ONE continuous paragraph. No line breaks, no newlines, no blank lines anywhere in the output. Every sentence flows directly after the previous one separated only by a single space.**

The paragraph follows this structure:

1. **OPENING SENTENCE** (use this verbatim): ${getOpeningTemplate(params)}
2. **NARRATIVE** (2-4 concise sentences): Go DIRECTLY into the first accomplishment. Do NOT add filler or preamble such as "During this period," or "In this important assignment." Use short transitions: "Additionally," "Furthermore," "Finally," Each sentence: ACTION → SCOPE → IMPACT. Use rank-appropriate verbs: ${verbs.primary.join(", ")}, ${verbs.secondary.join(", ")}
3. **CLOSING SENTENCE** (use this verbatim): ${getClosingTemplate(params, config.closingIntensity)}

## ACCOMPLISHMENTS TO INCORPORATE

${params.accomplishments.map((a, i) => `${i + 1}. ${a}`).join("\n")}

## QUALITY STANDARDS

- CONCISENESS is paramount — every word must earn its place
- Use ACTIVE VOICE and FORCEFUL VERBS
- Keep the SOURCE numbers and metrics from the accomplishments — do not inflate or convert them unnecessarily
- **SINGLE PARAGRAPH** — no line breaks or newlines anywhere in the output
- **FINAL CHECK: Re-count your output. It MUST be ≤ ${maxChars} characters total. If over, shorten or merge sentences until it fits.**

## OUTPUT

Generate ONLY the citation as a single continuous paragraph — no headers, notes, line breaks, or commentary. Ready to paste directly onto ${config.afForm}.`;
