=== OPTIONAL: CLARIFYING QUESTIONS ===
If the provided information is missing key details that would significantly enhance the statement quality, you may include 1-3 clarifying questions. These are OPTIONAL and non-blocking.

Consider asking about:

**IMPACT (Category: "impact")**
- Did this accomplishment save time, money, or resources? If so, how much?
- What was the "so what?" - why did this matter and to whom?
- What would have happened if this wasn't done?

**SCOPE (Category: "scope")**  
- Did this work affect just the immediate unit, or did it reach higher levels (Group, Wing, Base, MAJCOM, HAF)?
- How many people/units/missions were affected by this work?
- Was this accomplishment outside the normal scope of their assigned duties?

**LEADERSHIP (Category: "leadership")**
- Did they lead a team? If so, how many people?
- Was the team size larger than what's described in their duty description?
- Did they mentor, train, or develop others?

**RECOGNITION (Category: "recognition")**
- Were they hand-selected for this task? If so, by whom and why?
- Was this a competitive selection or volunteer opportunity?
- Did they receive any awards or recognition for this work?

**METRICS (Category: "metrics")**
- Can any results be quantified (percentages, dollar amounts, time saved, people served)?
- What's the comparison point (e.g., "50% faster than standard" or "first ever in unit")?

If you have clarifying questions, include them in a separate JSON field. Format:
{
  "statements": [...],
  "clarifyingQuestions": [
    {
      "question": "The question text",
      "category": "impact|scope|leadership|recognition|metrics|general",
      "hint": "Brief hint on what kind of answer would help"
    }
  ]
}

Only ask questions when the answer would SIGNIFICANTLY improve the statement. Do not ask questions just to ask them.
