CRITICAL RULES:
1. The statement MUST be ${targetChars} characters or LESS - this is a hard limit
2. READABILITY IS #1 PRIORITY: Statement must be scannable in 2-3 seconds
3. SENTENCE STRUCTURE (CRITICAL):
   - Maximum 3-4 action clauses - NO laundry lists of 5+ actions
   - Use PARALLEL verb structure (consistent verb tense throughout)
   - Place the STRONGEST IMPACT at the END of the statement
   - If it sounds like a run-on when read aloud, rewrite it more concisely
4. If multiple accomplishments are provided, synthesize into ONE cohesive statement
5. Preserve the most important metrics and impacts
6. NEVER use banned verbs: ${BANNED_VERBS.map(v => `"${v}"`).join(", ")}
7. Use alternatives: Led, Directed, Drove, Championed, Transformed, Pioneered, Accelerated
8. Structure: [Action] + [Scope/Details] + [BIGGEST IMPACT LAST]
9. Do NOT use bullet points or numbered lists
10. Do NOT end with a period (system adds one when combining)
11. Output ONLY the statement text, no quotes or explanation
