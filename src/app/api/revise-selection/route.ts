**⚠️ THIS IS A DUTY DESCRIPTION - NOT A PERFORMANCE STATEMENT ⚠️**

A duty description describes the member's CURRENT ROLE, SCOPE, and RESPONSIBILITIES.
It is purely factual and descriptive - it states WHAT the member's job encompasses, NOT how well they perform.

**DUTY DESCRIPTION WRITING RULES:**
1. USE PRESENT TENSE - describes a current, ongoing role (e.g., "drives", "supports", "coordinates", "manages")
2. NEVER use past tense performance verbs (e.g., "led", "directed", "ensured", "bolstered", "enhanced")
3. NEVER use subjective performance adjectives (e.g., "expertly", "skillfully", "effectively", "proficiently")
4. NEVER add accomplishment results or impact language (e.g., "ensured seamless integration", "bolstered command capabilities")
5. Describe SCOPE and RESPONSIBILITY - team size, mission area, organizations supported, programs owned
6. Use descriptive framing like "As a [role]", "Serving as [position]", or direct present-tense descriptions
7. Do NOT invent new facts or add scope that isn't in the original - only rephrase existing content

**GOOD DUTY DESCRIPTION VERBS (present tense, descriptive):**
drives, supports, coordinates, manages, oversees, advises, maintains, provides, enables, serves as, operates, sustains, 
ensures (only for describing an ongoing responsibility), administers, represents, liaises, synchronizes, integrates, 
conducts, facilitates (for coordination, not accomplishments), monitors, evaluates, governs, directs (present tense only)

**BAD - NEVER USE THESE IN DUTY DESCRIPTIONS:**
- Past-tense performance verbs: led, directed, managed, executed, ensured (past), bolstered, enhanced, strengthened, championed, pioneered
- Subjective adjectives: expertly, skillfully, proficiently, adeptly, effectively, seamlessly
- Accomplishment/result language: "resulting in", "enabling X% improvement", "saving $X", "bolstering capabilities"
- Cliché openers: "Charged as", "Selected as", "Piloted" (these imply performance, not scope)

**EXAMPLE - CORRECT DUTY DESCRIPTION STYLE:**
"As a crew operations subject matter expert, he drives a 3-member cyber event coordination team during a numbered AF transition, supporting the elevation of AFSOUTH to a Service Component Command and establishing AFSOUTH's first ever MAJCOM Cyber Coordination Center."

**EXAMPLE - WRONG (performance language, past tense):**
"Charged as crew ops SME, he expertly led a 3-mbr cyber event coordination team during a Numbered AF transition, enabling AFSOUTH's elevation to a Service Component Command & standing up AFSOUTH's initial MAJCOM Cyber Coordination Center. His guidance ensured seamless integration & enhanced cyber readiness."`;

**FORBIDDEN PUNCTUATION (DO NOT USE UNDER ANY CIRCUMSTANCES):**
- Em-dashes: -- (ABSOLUTELY NEVER use these)
- Semicolons: ;

**USE ONLY:** Commas (,) and "and"/"&" to connect clauses

**PRESERVE THESE EXACTLY (never change):**

- Acronyms (e.g., "AFSOUTH", "MAJCOM", "AF")
- Proper nouns and organizational names
- Team sizes and specific scope details

CRITICAL RULES:
1. PRESENT TENSE ONLY - "drives", "supports", "coordinates" - NOT "led", "drove", "supported"
2. NO performance adjectives - NO "expertly", "skillfully", "seamlessly"
3. NO accomplishment results or impact beyond describing the role's scope
4. Each of your ${versionCount} alternatives MUST use DIFFERENT opening structures
5. Output ONLY the revised text - no quotes, no explanation
6. Maintain grammatical coherence with surrounding text
7. NEVER use em-dashes (--) - use COMMAS instead
8. KEEP factual content identical - only rephrase, do not invent new scope or responsibilities
9. Prefer "&" over "and" when saving space
10. AVOID the word "the" where possible - it wastes characters`;

11. AVOID the word "the" - it wastes characters (e.g., "led the team" → "led 4-mbr team" - always quantify scope)

STEP 3: Calculate compliance:
- Is your count between ${targetMin} and ${maxChars}? 
- If YES: ✓ COMPLIANT - include this revision
- If NO: ❌ NOT COMPLIANT - proceed to STEP 4

STEP 4: If NOT COMPLIANT:
- If UNDER ${targetMin}: Expand words, add scope, add adjectives
- If OVER ${maxChars}: Use abbreviations, remove weak words, condense
- REPEAT from STEP 2 until compliant

STEP 5: Only output revisions that are ${targetMin}-${maxChars} characters
