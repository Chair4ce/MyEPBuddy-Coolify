### What We Use

The bullet fitting and text optimization features in MyEPBuddy's Award Statement Generator are based on techniques from the pdf-bullets project. This includes:

- **Character Width Calculations:** Pre-measured pixel widths for Times New Roman 12pt font to accurately predict how text will render on AF forms.

- **Space Optimization Algorithm:** Using Unicode thin/medium space characters (`\u2006` and `\u2004`) to compress or expand text to fit within form line constraints.

- **Adobe Line Breaking Logic:** Replicating how Adobe PDF forms break lines to ensure accurate predictions.

- **Form Dimension Data:** Accurate measurements for AF Form 1206, 707, 910, and 911.

### Why This Matters

The pdf-bullets project has saved countless hours for Air Force personnel writing bullets for EPRs, OPRs, and Awards. By creating a web-based tool that accurately simulates PDF form rendering, ckhordiasma has made a significant contribution to the Air Force community.

### Our Commitment

We commit to:
- Maintaining proper attribution in our codebase and UI
- Linking back to the original project
- Respecting the MIT license terms
- Encouraging users to also check out the original pdf-bullets tool
